Passing Command Line Arguments to a Module

Modules can take command line arguments, but not with the argc/argv you might be used to.

To allow arguments to be passed to your module, declare the variables that will take the values of the command line arguments as global and then use the module_param() macro, (defined in linux/moduleparam.h) to set the mechanism up. At runtime, insmod will fill the variables with any command line arguments that are given, like ./insmod mymodule.ko myvariable=5. The variable declarations and macros should be placed at the beginning of the module for clarity. The example code should clear up my admittedly lousy explanation.

The module_param() macro takes 3 arguments: the name of the variable, its type and permissions for the corresponding file in sysfs. Integer types can be signed as usual or unsigned. If you'd like to use arrays of integers or strings see module_param_array() and module_param_string().

int myint = 3;
module_param(myint, int, 0);


I would recommend playing around with this code:

# sudo insmod hello-5.ko mystring="bebop" mybyte=255 myintArray=-1
mybyte is an 8 bit integer: 255
myshort is a short integer: 1
myint is an integer: 20
mylong is a long integer: 9999
mystring is a string: bebop
myintArray is -1 and 420

# rmmod hello-5
Goodbye, world 5

# sudo insmod hello-5.ko mystring="supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" \
> mybyte=256 myintArray=-1,-1
mybyte is an 8 bit integer: 0
myshort is a short integer: 1
myint is an integer: 20
mylong is a long integer: 9999
mystring is a string: supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
myintArray is -1 and -1

# rmmod hello-5
Goodbye, world 5

# sudo insmod hello-5.ko mylong=hello
hello-5.o: invalid argument syntax for mylong: 'h'
