sysfs: Interacting with your module
sysfs allows you to interact with the running kernel by reading or setting variables inside of modules. This can be useful for debugging purposes, or just as an interface for userland applications or scripts.

Set the value of myvariable and check that it changed.
echo "32" > /sys/kernel/mymodule/myvariable
cat /sys/kernel/mymodule/myvariable
