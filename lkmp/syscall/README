Note that all the related problems make syscall stealing unfeasiable for production use. In order to keep people from doing potential harmful things sys_call_table is no longer exported. This means, if you want to do something more than a mere dry run of this example, you will have to patch your current kernel in order to have sys_call_table exported. In the example directory you will find a README and the patch.

sys_call_table is no longer supported, as it is dangerous to replace system calls . If you want to add explicitly, add the following to kyms.c and recompile the kernel.
EXPORT(sys_call_table)
