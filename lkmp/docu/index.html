    Kernel modules must have at least two functions a initialization
    function called <b>init_module </b>which is called when the module<br>
    is insmoded into the kernel, and a cleanup function called <b>cleanup_module</b>
    which is called just before the module is rmmoded.<br>

    As of Linux 2.4, <b>you can rename the init and cleanup functions
      of your modules; they no longer have to be</b><b>called
      init_module() and cleanup_module() respectively</b>. This is done
    with the <b>module_init()</b>and <b>module_exit() macros</b>.
    These macros are defined in linux/init.h. The only caveat is that
    yourinit and cleanup functions must be defined before calling the
    macros, otherwise you'll get compilation errors. <br>

      Need to clarify this later: <br>
      Now have a look at linux/drivers/char/Makefile for a real world
      example. As you can see, some<br>
      things get hardwired into the kernel (obj−y) but where are all
      those obj−m gone? Those familiar with shell<br>
      scripts will easily be able to spot them. For those not, the
      obj−$(CONFIG_FOO) </div2> entries you see everywhere<br>
    expand into obj−y or obj−m, depending on whether the CONFIG_FOO
    variable has been set to y or m. While<br>
    we are at it, those were exactly the kind of variables that you have
    set in the linux/.config file, the last<br>
    time when you said make menuconfig or something like that.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <big><big><b>hello−3.c<br>
        </b></big></big><br>
    <br>
    There is also an <b>__initdata</b> which works similarly to __init
    but for<b> init variables</b> rather than functions. <br>

    By setting the license to GPL, you can keep the<br>

    At runtime, insmod will fill the variables with any<br>
    command line arguments that are given, like ./insmod mymodule.ko
    myvariable=5.<br>

    <br>
    Lastly, there's a macro function, MODULE_PARM_DESC(), that is used
    to document arguments that the<br>
    module can take. It takes two parameters: a variable name and a free
    form string describing that variable.<br>

    <br>
    <br>
    Obviously, we strongly suggest you to recompile your kernel, so that
    you can enable a number of useful<br>
    debugging features, <div2> such as forced module unloading
      (MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD): when this option is<br>
      enabled, you can force the kernel to unload a module even when it
      believes it is unsafe, via a rmmod −f<br>
      module command</div2> . This option can save you a lot of time and
    a number of reboots during the development of<br>
    a module.<br>
    <br>
    Now, if you just install a kernel source tree, use it to compile
    your kernel module and you try to insert your<br>
    module into the kernel, in most cases you would obtain an error as
    follows:<br>
    insmod: error inserting 'poet_atkm.ko': −1 Invalid module format<br>
    Less cryptical information are logged to /var/log/messages:<br>
    <br>
    To overcome this problem we could resort to the −−force−vermagic
    option, but this solution is potentially<br>
    unsafe, and unquestionably inacceptable in production modules.
    Consequently, we want to compile our<br>
    module in an environment which was identical to the one in which our
    precompiled kernel was built. How to<br>
    do this, is the subject of the remainder of this chapter.<br>
